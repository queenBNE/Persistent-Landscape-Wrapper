# Persistent-Landscape-Wrapper
A Matlab wrapper for (part of) the [persistent landscape toolkit] (https://www.math.upenn.edu/~dlotko/persistenceLandscape.html) that was developed by Pawel Dlotko. See the paper [A persistence landscapes toolbox for topological statistics](http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00179) for details of the technique. 

## Installation
Clone or download the code in this repository. 

Download the source-code of the [persistent landscape toolkit] (https://www.math.upenn.edu/~dlotko/persistenceLandscape.html) and save it in the cpp folder in this repository. 

Open Matlab and go to the folder 'lib'. Run the script 'build_functions.m' to compile the C++ code for use in Matlab. 

## Usage

Open Matlab. Run the `load_peristence_lanscape.m' script and then run the 'examples.m' script.
